### An [#oxfordgeekjam](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23oxfordgeekjam) production

This game was produced in an Oxford Geek Jam (now dead) meet up.
We used SVN at the time, so I'm putting this into git now!

#### How to Play

> The Game of Hip, by Martin Gardner, is played on a 6Ã—6 board.
> Red and Blue alternate placing a stone of their color on the board.
> The first person to complete a square of their color, in any orientation, loses.
> Ignoring rotations and reflections, there is a unique tie game.
